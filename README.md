# Mangrove Decay

## Makes mangrove roots decay. Just like leaves!

The leaves of a tree gradually decay after the stem is removed. Why would the same not apply for the tree's roots? This mod adds that functionality to mangrove roots - so stripping down a mangrove tree becomes a lot easier.

## Implementation

Every time a mangrove root block decays it drops itself. This ensures that farming mangrove roots is not inhibited by this mod. 

As with leaves, mangrove roots that were placed by a player do not decay.
